# TP0 Automated Tests

## Setup

Install required packages (using pyenv or virtualenv is recommended)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running tests

Run pytest, passing the path to the repository as an environment variable.
The path is not a github URL, but the absolute path to the repository in your filesystem.

```
REPO_PATH=/path/to/repo pytest
```
